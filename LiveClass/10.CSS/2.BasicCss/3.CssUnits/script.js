/* 
    2 TYPES OF UNITS 


    1. ABSOLUTE
        px -> pixel
        cm -> centimeter
        mm -> millimeter
    

    2. RELATIVE
    whenever you want to create a responsive website we need to mostly try to use Relative units 

    // Length of an object would be in proportion to the PARENT Object.

    1. FONTS: em: Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)
             rem: Relative to font-size of the root element 

             em : scale relative to Parent (parent can be any box)
             rem: is used for consistent sizing throughout the application 
                scale relative to body tag. 

    2. View Ports: (VISIBLE screen ONLYZ)
        vh -> view height 
        vw -> view width

    3. Parent Relative Length -> % 
        with pecentage object looks at its parent
